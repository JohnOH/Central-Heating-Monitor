Sync Sequence
byte 4 = 2 with a checksum in byte 5 (byte 4 + x) == byte 5

Setback Sequence
byte 1 fixed at 166
byte 2 is assigned at sync time, 217 below
byte 3 is also allocated at sync time, could be an integer with byte 2
byte 4 is command In/Out for various values
byte 5 is command + a base value assigned during sync, 128 below.

The current slide switch settings are transmitted when batteries are inserted.
When sync is triggered the current slide switch settings are also included.

On powering up the boiler controller it goes into a learn mode where it will
pair with the first device it receives sending the pairing code 0x02 set. 
Once paired  the controller remembers its partner, only requiring a single packet
to stop the pairing LED from flashing on power up.

The In/Out signal from the OTO needs to be repeated otherwise the Controller 
drops out of setback mode. If the signal Out signal is not received after 
one hour then setback is cancelled by the Controller.
